# Mentors Plan

+ Two activities per month.

## Activities

### 1. Review Session

A face-to-face review session, related to the day’s lecture. Normally, this would happen between 6PM-9PM.

### 2. Online Session

A Google Hangout session to explain any topic, the main activitiy is to write code, but you can also recommend more resources like videos, courses, or anything you think it could be helpful for new students.

### 3. Q&A Session

It’s not mandatory to write code, this session should solve issues with specific questions.

To be more professional, I’ll schedule these sessions in the calendar, so all students can have time to attend with you guys, and appretiate their effort.
